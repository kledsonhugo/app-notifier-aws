Plan: 21 to add, 1 to change, 21 to destroy.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Saved the plan to: tfplan

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "tfplan"





Após esse plan, realizei um apply que resultou em um erro de VPC, o qual eu resolvi excluindo a VPC manualmente dentro do console da AWS. Após isso, realizei o plan abaixo novamente:



logonrmlocal@L2303MICRO15 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Checkpoint/app-notifier/terraform (main)
$ terraform plan -input=false -out tfplan

module.network.aws_internet_gateway.igw: Refreshing state... [id=igw-0612a01341a6e2ff8]

Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the
last "terraform apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # module.network.aws_internet_gateway.igw has been deleted
  - resource "aws_internet_gateway" "igw" {
      - id       = "igw-0612a01341a6e2ff8" -> null

Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the
relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may include
actions to undo or respond to these changes.
